# High Level Docusaurus Website Overview

From high level view, Docusaurus Website on GitHub pages consists of the following:  

1. Creating GitHub Pages Repository  
   This allows hosting of basic Markdown pages and then accessing them through Url like:  
   `https://yourusername.github.io/your-project`

1. Adding Docusaurus Website Builder into GitHub Pages  
   This configures Docusaurus Framework to be consumed by GitHub Pages  
   At this point you will already have a fully fledged Free Docusaurus website at:  
   `https://yourusername.github.io/your-project`

Then, final, Optional, but Non-Free step is to connect GitHub Pages site to Domain Name  

1. (Optional) Connecting GitHub Pages to Domain Controller  
   This will allow access to your website from your purchased Url:  
   `https://yoururl.com`
